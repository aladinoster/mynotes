# My notes on code

This repo contains notes about code learning, examples and other 
feel free to check internal `README` files in order to get more
details about the examples. 

## Organisation

This repo will be organized by programming languages. The main idea
is to create specific examples for cases that have been under study
rather than retrieve existing examples from the web. 

## Execution 

Regularly each folder should contain basic information on how to 
reproduce the experiment.
