# My Study Notes 

This are some of my study notes. I'm taking these notes on Jupyter Noteboks with the help of the [MyST](https://myst-tools.org) for better rendering. 

## To reproduce

1. Clone

```
https://github.com/aladinoster/mynotes.git
```

1. Install the package via:

```
$ cd mynotes
$ poetry install 
```

2. Render the notebooks via [myst](https://myst-tools.org/docs/mystjs/quickstart-myst-websites): 

```
$ myst 
```

or launch 

```
poetry run jupyterlab 
```

and check within the `notebooks` folder
